## Common Use Cases - Quick Starts
We recommend starting with the following quick start guides. 

### Drop-in Gift Cards
The Drop-in Gift Card solution empowers you to offer gift cards from your site in days. It is component based, using simple HTML snippets.
When a customer redeems a gift card, the value is applied to an account that belongs to the customer, also managed by Lightrail.
Minor updates must be made to your checkout process to allow the customer's account to be used as a payment option.

With customer accounts in place you can learn from their purchase history and drive engagement using promotions.

### Promotions
Lightrail promotions are rule-based value that are attached to gift cards or accounts.
Promotions can be used to incentive when customers by, along with what they buy.
For example, a promotion could be a _$10 off boxing week sale_ or _$5 off if your purchase is over $25_; the possibilities are endless.
