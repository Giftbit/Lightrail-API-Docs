### [DELETE] /accounts/{account_id}/flags/{flag}
**Remove Account Configuration Flag**

Removes a specific configuration flag from a customer account, reverting to default behavior or inheriting from parent account.

Flag removal enables account management flexibility and allows accounts to inherit settings from parent accounts in the hierarchy. All changes are audited for compliance and operational tracking.

This operation is idempotent - removing a non-existent flag returns 204 without error.

#### Parameters

| ---- | ---------- | ----------- | -------- | ------ |
| Idempotency-Key | header | Client-generated key to ensure idempotent request processing.  Prevents duplicate operations when the same request is made multiple times. Include this header for all state-changing operations to ensure safe retry behavior and prevent unintended duplicates.  | No | string |
| account_id | path | Unique identifier for an account within your organization's hierarchy.  Account IDs are used consistently across all API operations to reference specific accounts in role assignments, control configurations, and resource management.  | Yes | [UUID](#uuid) |
| flag | path | Flag value on path. Must be one of the AccountFlags values. | Yes | [AccountFlags](#accountflags) |

#### DefaultOrderValueControl

Default order value control for standardizing order amounts.

Sets a standard default amount and currency for new orders to streamline the ordering process and provide consistent user experience. This control is inheritable, allowing organizations to establish standard order amounts across account hierarchies.

| Name | Type | Description | Required |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| enabled | boolean | Whether default order value standardization is active.  When false, no default values are pre-populated in order interfaces. When true, the specified amount and currency are used as defaults for new orders. <br>*Example:* `true` | Yes |
| value | [AmountWithCurrency](#amountwithcurrency) | Standard default amount and currency for new orders with this account.  This value will be pre-populated in order interfaces when the control is enabled, providing consistency and reducing user input requirements.  | Yes |

**Example**
<pre>{
  "enabled": true,
  "value": {
    "currency": "USD",
